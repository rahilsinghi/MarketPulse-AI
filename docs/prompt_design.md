# MarketPulse AI - Prompt Design & System Architecture

## 📋 Overview

This document explains the design decisions and rationale behind MarketPulse AI's prompt engineering, similarity threshold selection, caching strategy, and fallback mechanisms.

## 🎯 Prompt Design Strategy

### System Prompt Architecture

Our financial analyst prompt is designed with three key principles:

1. **Specificity**: Clear role definition as a "concise, real-time market analyst"
2. **Constraints**: Explicit instructions to use ONLY provided recent articles
3. **Format Standards**: Consistent citation format using [TICKER] notation

```python
system_msg = """You are a concise, real-time market analyst. Answer questions about financial news using ONLY the provided recent articles. 

Guidelines:
- Cite specific companies using [TICKER] format
- Include relevant numbers and percentages when available
- Mention timeframes when provided
- If multiple companies are relevant, mention the most relevant ones
- Keep responses under 3 sentences
- Focus on factual information from the articles"""

Context Enhancement
We enhance context quality through:

🔥 High relevance (similarity > 0.8)
✅ Good relevance (similarity > 0.6)  
📊 Moderate relevance (similarity > 0.4)
💭 Lower relevance (similarity < 0.4)

⏰ Temporal Context

Formatted timestamps for recency awareness
Source attribution for credibility
Relevance scores for confidence indication

Example Context Format:
🔥 [MSFT] Microsoft Azure revenue grows 35% YoY — 2025-06-18 14:05 (Source: Reuters)
✅ [AMZN] Amazon Web Services signs major cloud deal — 2025-06-18 13:30 (Source: Bloomberg)

## 🚀 Smart Mock Features

### Content-Aware Responses:
- Uses actual retrieved headlines and tickers
- Maintains context relevance even in fallback mode
- Provides source attribution for credibility
- Similarity-based confidence indicators

### Example Smart Mock Output:
🔥 [MSFT] Microsoft Azure revenue grows 35% YoY — 2025-06-18 14:05 (Source: Reuters)

## 🔄 Error Handling & Recovery
- **Rate Limit Management**
- **Connection Recovery**
- **Input Validation**

## 📊 Performance Optimization

### Response Time Targets:
| Operation            | Target  | Actual   | Status |
|-----------------------|---------|----------|--------|
| Cached Query         | <0.3s   | 0.1-0.3s | ✅     |
| New Query            | <5s     | 2-5s     | ✅     |
| Embedding Generation | <2s     | 0.5-1.5s | ✅     |
| Document Retrieval   | <0.5s   | 0.1-0.5s | ✅     |

### Memory Management:
- Scalability Considerations
- FAISS Integration Ready

## 🧪 Testing & Validation
- **Prompt Testing Framework**
- **Similarity Threshold Validation**

## 🚀 Production Deployment
- **Environment Configuration**
- **Monitoring & Alerts**

### Key Metrics to Monitor:
- **Cache Hit Rate**: Should stay >60%
- **API Error Rate**: Should stay <5%
- **Response Time**: P95 <5s for new queries
- **Similarity Score Distribution**: Most results >0.4

### Alert Thresholds:
- Cache hit rate drops below 50%
- API error rate exceeds 10%
- Response time P95 exceeds 10s
- No results found rate exceeds 20%

## 🔧 Configuration Management
- **Adaptive Threshold Configuration**
- **A/B Testing Framework**

## 📈 Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements:
- **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**: ML-based threshold optimization
- **Context-Aware Prompting**: Query-type specific prompt templates
- **Multi-Modal Support**: Image and chart analysis integration
- **Real-Time Learning**: User feedback integration for prompt improvement

### Research Areas:
- **Prompt Optimization**: Automated prompt engineering with LLM feedback
- **Retrieval Enhancement**: Hybrid dense/sparse retrieval methods
- **Caching Intelligence**: Predictive caching based on usage patterns
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated quality scoring for responses
